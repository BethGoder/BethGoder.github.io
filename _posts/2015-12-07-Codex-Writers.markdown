I’m super excited about joining Codex Writers--a group for neo-pro writers of speculative fiction. Everyone seems quite friendly, and I’ve already spent a couple of hours reading the forums.

There are a few ways to qualify for Codex membership, which leads me to my other exciting news. I’ve had a short story accepted by a pro market on the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) list. This is only my second acceptance, so I was totally surprised and delighted. Once I sign the contract, I’ll post more details, but for now, I’m just going to squee a bit.
