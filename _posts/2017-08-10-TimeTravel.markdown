Flame Tree Press has put out another gorgeous anthology of short fiction. The [Time Travel Anthology]( http://flametreepublishing.com/Time-Travel-Short-Stories.html) has stories from contemporary writers, as well as classics like H.G. Wells.

I'm thrilled that "Murder or a Duck" will be appearing next to these fabulous stories from writers all across the timeline.

Here's a [look at the inspiration]( http://blog.flametreepublishing.com/fantasy-gothic/time-travel-author-qa-story-inspirations) behind some of the stories.
