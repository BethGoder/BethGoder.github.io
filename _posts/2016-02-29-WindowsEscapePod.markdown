["Windows"](http://escapepod.org/2016/02/29/ep523-windows/) is up at *Escape Pod* for Artemis Rising II.

>After just three years, most of Gurt’s downtown was nearly unrecognizable. Roldan Street boasted a new tea shop, and the roads had been repaved with greenish eco-tar. Even the old sign at Marta’s Bakery, which had been shaped like a pink cupcake, was replaced with sleek blue lettering.

>Score another one for the prophetic soup.

The episode is wonderfully narrated by Andrea Richardson--her reading makes the story come alive. I enjoyed the comments of guest host Kate Baker, who discusses the need for Artemis Rising, and has some nifty things to say about my story, too.

Where did the idea for this story come from? I started writing without an outline, and all sorts of things found their way in--anthropology, archives, holograms. But mostly, I wanted to write about prophetic soup.
