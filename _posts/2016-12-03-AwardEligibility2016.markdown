It's that time of year. Science fiction and fantasy authors everywhere are posting lists of their award eligible work. This is my first year participating! Achievement unlocked? 
Here's a list of my award eligible work for 2016:

### [Murder or a Duck]( http://escapepod.org/2016/10/13/ep545-murder-or-a-duck/) (4,000 words, Escape Pod)

This is my favorite thing I had published this year. Steampunk and time travel, afternoon tea and proper ladies (who turn out to be not so proper after all), and a great deal of silliness.

### Eating the Sun (700 words, [Mothership Zeta]( http://mothershipzeta.org/2016/07/28/issue-4-is-out-now/))

Space poetry, an epic journey, an alien-godling and sentient sun.

### [Windows]( http://escapepod.org/2016/02/29/ep523-windows/) (4,000 words, Escape Pod)

Anthropology, archives, holograms, prophetic soup.

### [The Forgetting Place]( https://zeteticrecord.org/2016/11/the-forgetting-place/) (700 words, Zetetic)

Memory and the relationship between the past and the present.

### [The Wish Giver]( https://zeteticrecord.org/2016/02/the-wish-giver/) (1,500 words, Zetetic)

A look at what would happen if someone refused to have a wish granted.

This is my first year of eligibility for the Campbell Award.
