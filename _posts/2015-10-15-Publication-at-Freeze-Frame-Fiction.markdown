My flash fiction piece [“The Sound That Carries Across the Ocean”](http://freezeframefiction.com/read/q6-flash-fiction/the-sound-that-carries-across-the-ocean-by-beth-goder/) is up at Freeze Frame Fiction.

If you like reading about sea monsters and drinking songs, you might enjoy this one.

The story is illustrated with some wonderful art by Luke Spooner of [Carrion House](http://www.carrionhouse.com/).
