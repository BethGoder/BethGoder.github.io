My goodness, the deadline for Hugo nominations is less than a month away. I want to get my nominating done early, because deadlines like that tend to creep up on me.

I read quite a few short stories last year. Probably between 200 and 300. (Thank you, golden age of short fiction.) After all of that reading, I've narrowed it down to 10 stories I'm considering for my ballot. I don't know how I'll pick between them, because they're all amazing. It was hard enough getting it down to 10.

So here's my list. I'm putting it in alphabetical order by title. If you're nominating, or just looking for some excellent short fiction, I encourage you to take a look at these stories.
