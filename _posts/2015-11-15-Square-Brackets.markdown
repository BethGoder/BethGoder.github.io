What’s the best writing advice I’ve ever received?

Use square brackets.

Seriously, this has helped me so much. My first drafts (and second and third) have square brackets scattered throughout.

I use square brackets to indicate sections that need work, so that I can write without breaking flow.

Instead of stopping to look up the internal components of a lawn mower, I can write:

> I jammed the [weird thingy inside the lawn mower] with a wrench.

Instead of trying to figure out believable dialogue on my first try, I can write:

> [“As you know, Bob, the aliens are invading right now,” she said. “And they don’t look happy.”]

Here’s an actual example from a work in progress:

> He began the class by reviewing [physics thing], his [some identifying characteristic.]

Who knows if any of that sentence will make it to the final draft? Or any of that scene?

And that’s another good thing about square brackets. I don’t have to waste time getting each scene right in an early draft, since at that point, I’m still playing around with the structure of the story. I can block out the scene, writing down a rough idea of how I think it will go. If I switch stuff up, or even delete the scene entirely, I won’t have wasted time doing unnecessary research or agonizing over a sentence that I didn’t even keep.

Square brackets are searchable, so if I want to do some quick revisions, I can find the places that need work. I also use brackets to block off new sections of writing to review later.

And the brackets are a visual reminder that a draft doesn’t have to be perfect. When I stick something in square brackets, I feel relieved, knowing that I’ll go back over it again and make it better.
