Hello, world! It’s my first post here, so I’ll talk a little bit about my background and why I started writing.

I’m an archivist by trade, with a degree in Information Science from the University of Michigan. I’ve cataloged the digitized letters of Theodore Roosevelt, processed the papers of Edward Teller, and handled some really amazing materials--photographs of the Burma walkout taken by a WWII soldier, letters from Herbert Hoover concerning the Commission for Relief in Belgium, and the flight logs of Jane Spencer, a pilot of the British Air Transport Auxiliary.

Every day as an archivist is exciting, because you never know what you might find in that manuscript box sitting on your desk.

Currently, I’m a full-time mom to two wonderful twin girls. Although I miss the archives, caring for my children makes me the happiest I’ve ever been. I’m so grateful that I get to stay home with them.

I started writing a few months after my kids were born. (Which is a little bananas, because writing is hard enough without being sleep deprived.)

I enjoy writing because it gives me something to think about, wherever I am. Each story is like a grand puzzle that I’ll never fully solve.

I’ve been writing steadily throughout the year and hope that this trend continues.
