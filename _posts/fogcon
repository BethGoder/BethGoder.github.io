I went to FOGcon for the first time this year. What a lovely local convention with lots of interesting panels on writing, science, and speculative literature. (Great environment for thinking up new story ideas.) In addition, I did my first (non-school) in-person writing workshop. If I have time, I'll post some of my notes about panels.
