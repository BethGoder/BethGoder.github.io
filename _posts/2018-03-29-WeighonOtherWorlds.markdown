I'm so pleased to announce that I have a new story in the first issue of Factor Four Magazine. "Our Weight on Other Worlds" is a flash fiction story about home, family, and tension between wanting a new life and clinging to what you have.

Snippet:
> The spaceship leaves in two hours. It's not enough time for Clara to decide.

When I was writing this story, I was thinking about applying literary techniques to scientific concepts within a story (like in the amazing "I'm Alive, I Love You, I'll see you in Reno," by Vylar Kaftan.) I tried to use facts about Mars to create this effect, bringing those ideas back again and again in this short space.
