On her website and at Book View Cafe, Ursula K. Le Guin has been [answering questions about writing](http://ursulakleguin.com/Index-NavigatingOceanOfStory.html). One of the greatest authors of our time is willing to answer our questions--this is an amazing gift.

Her [latest entry](http://ursulakleguin.com/Index-NavigatingOceanOfStory.html) has selected comments about online critique groups, including one from yours truly. I can say without hesitation that Le Guin is my favorite author, and has been for a long time, so having her respond to something I wrote (even just a brief comment) leaves me speechless.

Le Guin is generously offering to answer more questions. You'll find the form at the bottom of her latest entry (linked above). I have questions about everything--plot, structure, characterization, foreshadowing, etc. Basically, all possible aspects of writing. It will be difficult to narrow down the list to one specific question. Hope I can get it in before the queue fills up.
