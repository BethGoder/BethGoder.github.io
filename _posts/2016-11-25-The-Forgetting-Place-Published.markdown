My story ["The Forgetting Place"]( https://zeteticrecord.org/2016/11/the-forgetting-place/) is up at _Zetetic: A Record of Unusual Inquiry_.

Snippet:

> In the Forgetting Place, a person forgets two thingsâ€”a memory of happiness, a memory of sorrow. Sometimes it is the same memory.

[You can read the rest here.]( https://zeteticrecord.org/2016/11/the-forgetting-place/)

This short, almost dream-like story was written in one burst and then revised several times. The idea came quite suddenly, and I can't say exactly why. As an archivist, I think a lot about how memory affects our lives--both our personal memories and collective memory. If what happens before shapes what happens after, then how would a person be affected if she decided to give up the memory of a formative event? How would her understanding of the value of memories change over time?

Mostly, I didn't think about these questions as I was writing that first draft, although I thought about them after. Instead, I had this image of a woman traveling back the way she had once gone--to the Forgetting Place.
