After looking in my inbox last week, there was much joyous shouting. And lo! Two acceptances.

"Eating the Sun," a flash fiction story, will be in Issue 4 of _Mothership Zeta_.  A hungry godling needs energy. Good thing there's a sun close by.

"Murder or a Duck" will be published in _Escape Pod_. Time travel, tea time, and the possibility of murder (or a duck).
