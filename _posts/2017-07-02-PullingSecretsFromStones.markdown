My newest story, "Pulling Secrets From Stones," is out in [issue 3 of Mythic Magazine]( https://www.createspace.com/7272913).

Snippet:
> In the lakebed by the mountains slept stones full of secrets. Waiting memories. Dissipating memories. Rachel could feel the hum of them, their longing for closeness, pressing against her as the sun pressed down.

In this story, I wanted to write about the magic of ordinary things--stones and memories, trucks and dusty land, rain and mountains. There's longing and a trusty Toyota Stout and the memory of spontaneous berry pie.

I also wanted to write a character who's older and wild and doesn't conform to society's expectations. That's the woman in the mountains, who refused, for this story, to even accept a less mythic name.
